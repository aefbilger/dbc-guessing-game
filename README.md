M08 Exercises: Guessing Game, Wheel of Fortune, and Multiplayer Wheel of Fortune

The guessing_game.py file contains the script code for a simple, hangman-style word guessing game.

The wheel_of_fortune.py file contains an updated guessing game that combines the simple hangman game rules with Wheel of Fortune mechanics, including randomly rolled rewards (or punishments!). As of right now, only single player play is supported. 

words.txt is used to select the words used for these puzzles. If you prefer to use a differnt wordset in your game, you may create a new txt file containing those words. The filename used can be updated in line 97 of guessing_game.py, or in line 108 pf wheel_of_fortune.py.

A multiplayer version of Wheel of Fortune is currently in development! Keep an eye out for an update containing this exciting new game mode.
